## express-ejs-crud

This is my first website built with **express.js** and **ejs** template engine. In the other side i learn how to connect mongoDB to express.js with mongoClient.

So this is the packages i use for this web
1. express and express-ejs-layout (for layouting the website)
1. ejs 
1. mongodb 
1. nodemon

Hope this will help anyone that looking for how to build website with express.js and especially ejs template engine.

### Thank You!!
